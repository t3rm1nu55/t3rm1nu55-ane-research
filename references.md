# Tracked references

Sources watched by the daily research agent. When new activity appears in any of these, the agent updates `journal.md`.

Organized by category. Each entry has: URL, last-checked date, short description, and (if applicable) "why it matters" for the main `t3rm1nu55-monitorplus` project.

## How to add a new reference

The daily agent appends new references to the appropriate section. Humans can also add entries directly. When adding:
1. Include the URL
2. Include `Last checked: YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Include a 1-line description
4. Include a "why it matters" note for the main `t3rm1nu55-monitorplus` project
5. Commit with `docs: track <source>`
